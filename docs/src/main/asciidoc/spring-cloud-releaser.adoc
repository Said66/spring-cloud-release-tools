Spring Cloud Releaser
====================

This project can be used to

- update all versions in your Spring Cloud Project according to the Spring Cloud Release setup

== How to run it

Currently we only support running the releaser to update the poms from Java

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-release-tools
cd releaser
./mvnw clean package
----

and then go to your project (e.g. Spring Cloud Sleuth)

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth
cd spring-cloud-sleuth
java -jar ~/path/to/cloned/spring-cloud-release-tools/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring/target/releaser-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar
----

The application will start running from your working directory.

== Future plans

In the future it can also:

- commit the changed values
- perform a release

Other plans:

- add a Maven plugin to perform the work from Maven
